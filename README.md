# Height-Prediction-using-SLR

Project Title: Predicting Height from Weight with Simple Linear Regression

# Description:

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict the height of individuals based on their weight using the scikit-learn library in Python. It serves as a practical introduction to linear regression concepts and their application in data analysis.

# Libraries Used:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
numpy: Numerical computations
seaborn: Data visualization
matplotlib: Plotting
Data Source:

This project utilizes a weight and height dataset retrieved from Kaggle. (Replace with the specific dataset name if known)

# Project Steps:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Import necessary libraries.
Load the weight and height data using pandas.read_csv().
Explore the data by obtaining summary statistics (mean, standard deviation) and visualizations (histograms, scatter plots) with pandas and seaborn.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., remove rows, impute values).
Identify and address any outliers that might significantly impact the model.

# Model Building:

Import the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn.
Split the data into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split() function.
Instantiate a LinearRegression object.
Fit the model to the training data with the fit() method.

# Model Evaluation:

Predict heights for the testing set using the predict() method.
Calculate performance metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE) with scikit-learn's mean_squared_error() function.
R-squared (coefficient of determination) with scikit-learn's r2_score() function.
Visualize the predicted vs. actual heights using matplotlib or seaborn.
Interpretation and Conclusion:

Analyze the obtained model coefficients (slope and intercept) to understand the relationship between weight and height.
Summarize the model's performance and limitations.
Discuss potential improvements (e.g., model selection, feature engineering).
Running the Project:

# Clone this repository.
Install the required libraries using pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib.
.
Further Enhancements:

Experiment with different data preprocessing techniques (e.g., scaling).
Evaluate model performance with cross-validation.
Explore more advanced regression models (e.g., polynomial regression).
Visualize feature importance for more complex models.
